//Painting the Fence
//Given a fence with n posts and k colors, find out the number of ways of painting the fence so that not more than two consecutive posts have the same colors.
//Since the answer can be large return it modulo 109 + 7.

    //function to count no of ways
    public long countWays(int n,int k)

        //create an array to store no of ways for each no of fences

        //initialising dp array with 0
        Arrays.fill(dp,0);
        
        //setting base case,when there is only 1 fence
        dp[1]=k;
        
        //initialising variables to keep count and different color fence
        long same=0,diff=k;
