//The Celebrity Problem
//A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
//A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. Here M[i][i] will always be 0.
//Note: Follow 0 based indexing.
//Follow Up: Can you optimize it to O(N)

class Solution
{ 
    //Function to find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
    int celebrity(int M[][], int n)
    {
    	// initialising 2pointers for 2 corner
    	int a=0;
    	int b=n-1;
    	
    	//keep moving till a<b
    	while(a<b){
    	    if(M[a][b]==1)
    	        a++;
    	    else
    	        b--;
    	}
    	
    	//check if a is actually a celebrity or not
    	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    	    //if any person dont know a or a knows any person return -1
    	    if((i!=a) && (M[a][i]==1 || M[i][a]==0))
    	        return -1;
    	}
    	
    	//if reached here a is celebrity ,return a
    	return a;
    }
}
