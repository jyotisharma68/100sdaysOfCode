//Three way partitioning
//Given an array of size n and a range [a, b]. The task is to partition the array around the range such that array is divided into three parts.
//1) All elements smaller than a come first.
//2) All elements in range a to b come next.
//3) All elements greater than b appear in the end.
//The individual elements of three sets can appear in any order. You are required to return the modified array.

//Note: The generated output is 1 if you modify the given array successfully.
